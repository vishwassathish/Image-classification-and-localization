# Image-classification-and-localization
Image classifier for the VOC-2010 Dataset with and without Transfer Learning. 
Deep Convolutional Networks were used for classification and localization.

Packages and Dependencies Required :- <br />
	Keras (Tensorflow Background) <br />
	matplotlib <br />
	PIL (pillow) <br />
	jupyter notebook <br />
	numpy <br />
	pickle <br />

-> All the programs and networks are in "Codes" folder. Both ".py" and ".ipynb" (using jupyter notebook) files are attached.

-> NNfunctions.py is a program with all the utility functions used for Dataset creation  and Image localization.

-> Change the image folder paths to wherever your image dataset is stored .

For furthur details on Architecture, results and transfer learning implementation, refer "report.pdf" .
